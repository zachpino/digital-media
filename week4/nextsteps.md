###Next Steps
---

Much was accomplished [this week](readme.md). Our grid system was built, tested, and improved with responsive styles. And, we've brought visual elements into our designs through imagery and css properties.

Next week, Javascript instruction will begin, allowing the design of dynamic content and interactive elements. In preparation for that, we need a few things in place.

By next week, please populate a folder on your server `blog` with an html file called `post.html`. This file should contain a resposive grid system that flexes to accomodate different device and browser sizes. The file should be prepared to accept the following pieces of dynamic content (more will be possible, but this is the baseline).

- Post Title
- Subtitle
- Publish Date 
- Banner Image 
- Body Text
- Hero Image (to hold visualizations later)
- Gallery of Thumbnail Images
- Tags
- Citation Link

All elements should nest inside of the divs you built for your responsive grid.

Fill in *at least two duplicates* of that file with example content from data viz projects that you have found to be inspirational, by next Friday.
