###Week 1: Homework

-----

To prepare for Week 2, make sure all of the [previous steps](readme.md) are understood. In particular, ensure that [you get some practice moving around in your Terminal](bashintro.md).

-----

On your server, create the following folder and file structure.

 ```
- /var/www/html/
    - testmap/
        - datasets/
        - images/
        - scripts/
        - styles/ 
        - index.html
        - details.html
 ```

Add links so that `index.html` is connected to `details.html` and back again. 

After this is setup, you will be able to access the contents of `index.html` by visiting your IP address. 
 
 `35.166.246.200/testmap/`
 
 Make sure you replace that IP address with your own personal Amazon IP.

Also, please purchase a domain name and connect it to your IP address. [Hover.com](http://hover.com) is a recommendable registrar and doesn't support the [murder of endangered animals](http://www.geek.com/news/godaddy-ceo-bob-parsons-boasts-killing-an-elephant-leopard-on-vacation-video-1335435/), which is not a high bar to pass. Feel free to use a registrar of your choice, however.

Check out all the new [top-level-domains](https://help.hover.com/hc/en-us/articles/217281477-Supported-Top-Level-Domains-TLDs-) that are available now. Don't feel like you have to get a `.com` or `.net`. `.design`, `.art`, `.graphics`, and `.world` are great for this class too! You can always purchase different domains later, but you may want to include your name in the domain as a flexible base. Or perhaps, if you are confident, your provisional topic area. Names relating to data visualization will work too.

Use [this tutorial](https://help.hover.com/hc/en-us/articles/217282457-How-to-Edit-DNS-records-A-CNAME-MX-TXT-and-SRV-Updated-Aug-2015-) for connecting your domain and editing its `(A) Record`. Don't worry about any other Records. The process should be fairly similar across registrars. Note that domain changes take time to update, sometimes more than 24 hours.
